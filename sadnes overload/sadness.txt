Identify Large Files or Directories:

Use the du command to identify large files or directories:
bash
Copy code
sudo du -h --max-depth=1 /
This command will display the disk usage of each directory in the root filesystem. Look for large directories that may contain unnecessary files.
Clean Up Unnecessary Files:

Remove temporary files, log files, or any files that are no longer needed. For example, you can use the find and rm commands:
bash
Copy code
sudo find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -delete
Check Package Manager Cache:

Package managers like apt store downloaded packages in a cache. You can clean the package manager cache using:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get clean
Remove Unnecessary Packages:

Use the following command to remove packages that are no longer needed:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get autoremove
Check for Core Dumps:

Check if there are core dump files in the root directory and remove them:
bash
Copy code
sudo find / -name "core.*" -delete
