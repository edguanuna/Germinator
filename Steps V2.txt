#This is where everything new happens gets transforms pretty easy to read I
made it publish x,y,z Points so you can work on path planning only 1 issue described
below. I used ar_tag_1 as the car frame so moving stuff so everything is in terms of distance to that#

source devel/setup.bash
rosrun get_ar_pos ar_detector.py 


#So this is just a subscriber that subscribes to get_ar_pos only issue is that that
I have everything as rospy.spin() so it's jsut continously recieving stuff and this 
is also on rospy.spin() IDK how to use "rates" and "spin" and "sleep" I tried a few
stuff that didn't work. Publishing nodes are constantly publishing i think soo shrug
Try and see if you can figure this out maybe even ask on ED you'll see what I mean. Give
it like an hour and if not get started on path planning and you can make some static xyz points by placing down AR_TAGS and copying the info. Lab 8 was really helpful# 

source devel/setup.bash
rosrun path_planning path_planner.py
