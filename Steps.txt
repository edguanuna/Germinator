AR Tags are Printable from PNG
For calibration you need to print out a checkboard just look up ar_track_alvar calibration or it miggt be linked in meow
meow.txt has a bunch of random things I used in somewhat order
Steps After Calibrating
The calibration yaml should automatically be moved into .ros

roscore
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch sad run_cam.launch
    (might get a weird failed invalid argument "shouldnt matter")
roslaunch sad ar_track.launch 

At this point should be able to run rviz and just follow same steps as lab
rostopic list and rqt_graph are pretty cool
rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py lets you see TF but you can also see them in RVIZ

rosrun get_ar_pos ar_tag_pos_publisher.py 
    AlvarMarkers you can look up its just messages and they contain the different AR Markers sotred as markers which then have their own posees etc just look it up online
    You can ignore the whole meow function its what's causing it to break below
    
rosrun get_ar_pos tf_ar_tags.py 
    (this just gives distances from each other
        -hardcoded for now cause idk how to call it in the top without hardcoding)
        
This whole TF frame only matters rn b/c of the AR Tags. We have their x,y,z and everything relative to the camera but we want everything in terms of some "car" ar tag(can literally be any of the 4 etc)
     
Next Steps: Figure out how to get it in terms of TF and make sure it subscribes/publishes idk and then path plannings
